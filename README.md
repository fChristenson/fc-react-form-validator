## What we will cover

* What is a library?
* What makes a good library?
* How do we spot an oppertunity to make a library?

## Notes

When you are working on a feature you may find that you are solving
a problem that is common to not just you but in general.

General problems is the sort of problem that occurs for many programmers
as they work on their own projects.

When you spot a common problem you have the chance to ask the question
"does it make sense to make a library of this?".

Personally I believe that a good library solves a specific problem
in a reusable and easy to consume way.

I do not use libraries for small problems that will take me minutes
to build and I try not to use libraries that solves more problems
than I have.
